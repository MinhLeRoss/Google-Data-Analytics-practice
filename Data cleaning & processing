Dataset: Customer_id

SELECT 
country
 FROM `delta-repeater-359113.customer_data.customer_address` 
where
 length(country) > 2

--result being 2 countries with 3 characters length 'USA'
--We did not create this table therefore shouldnt change it, but we can use substring function to include USA in the list of all customres from the US

SELECT
distinct customer_id --removes duplicates
from
delta-repeater-359113.customer_data.customer_address
where
substr(country,1,2) = 'US' --include USA and US customer 


-- Now we clean the state
select
state
from
delta-repeater-359113.customer_data.customer_address
where
length(state)>2

--comes up with 'OH' which is only 2 characters, therefore the extra character must be a space
--We use the TRIM function to get rid of the extra space

select
distinct customer_id
from

where

--Data set: Customer_purchase
SELECT
purchase_price
  FROM `delta-repeater-359113.customer_data.customer_purchase` 
order by
cast (purchase_price as float64) desc --purchase price was set as a string type and not a float, so it did not sort in the correct order, so we cast it into a float type.
